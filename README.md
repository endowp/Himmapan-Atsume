A Java game that me and my friend created in 2019.

### Game Introduction
Himmapan Atsume is inspired by Neko Atsume game. In Neko Atsume there are many cats that may come to your place, but in Himmapan Atsume, we would like to provide information about Himmapan animals instead. There are many kinds of Himmapan animals in Himmapan forest, they may appear or disappear randomly.

### User Manual
Himmapan Atsume is an endless game, you can just wait for Himmapan animals to appear randomly at their normal rate, or buy items which will attract them to appear more often.
